summary: " 'Semantic Shifts in Mental Health-Related Concepts' - accepted in The 4th International Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change 2023 (LChange'23), collocated with the EMNLP-2023 conference"

abstract: 'This talk introduced the first study of my PhD evaluating semantic shifts in mental health-related concepts in two diachronic corpora spanning 1970-2016, one academic and one general. It evaluated whether their meanings have broadened to encompass less severe phenomena and whether they have become more pathology related. It applies a recently proposed methodology (Baes et al., 2023) to examine whether words collocating with a sample of mental health concepts have become less emotionally intense and develops a new way to examine whether the concepts increasingly co-occur with pathology-related terms. In support of the first hypothesis, mental health-related concepts became associated with less emotionally intense language in the psychology corpus (addiction, anger, stress, worry) and in the general corpus (addiction, grief, stress, worry). In support of the second hypothesis, mental health-related concepts came to be more associated with pathology-related language in psychology (addiction, grief, stress, worry) and in the general corpus (grief, stress). Findings demonstrate that some mental health concepts have become normalized and/or pathologized, a conclusion with important social and cultural implications.'
