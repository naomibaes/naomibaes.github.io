summary: "Invited talk (thanks to Principal Research Scientist Saif M Mohammad) at the National Research Council Canada on two complementary frameworks for studying lexical semantic change: (1) SIBling, which models change along three dimensions (Sentiment, Intensity, Breadth); and (2) LSC-Eval, which generates synthetic benchmarks for evaluating the suitability of methods for their sensitivity to detecting induced change. Together, they provide tools for tracing socially significant conceptual shifts, with demonstrated applications to mental health-related concepts."

abstract: "Lexical semantic change (LSC) provides insight into cultural and social dynamics, yet existing approaches often examine it in isolation, as a unitary construct, and lack historical benchmarks. I present two complementary frameworks. SIBling models semantic change along three dimensions – Sentiment (valence of a target’s contexts), Intensity (emotional arousal and use of intensifiers), and Breadth (diversity of usages) – offering an integrated way to trace how word meanings evolve. Case studies of mental health concepts show broadening, intensification, and shifts in sentiment that reflect cultural trends such as stigmatization, problematization, and concept creep. To evaluate such methods, I introduce LSC-Eval, a three-stage evaluation framework for generating synthetic datasets that simulate semantic change, test method sensitivity, and assess method suitability for specific dimensions and domains. Using LSC-Eval to test the SIB Toolkit validates its ability to capture synthetically induced change, and therefore naturally occurring change, and highlights challenges for state-of-the-art models in detecting affective dimensions of LSC. | Slides Above."
