summary: "Talk at Utrecht University's Natural Language and Text Processing Lab on two complementary frameworks for studying lexical semantic change: (1) SIBling, which models change along three dimensions (Sentiment, Intensity, Breadth); and (2) LSC-Eval, which generates synthetic benchmarks for evaluating methods. Together, they provide tools for tracing socially significant conceptual shifts, with applications to mental health concepts."

abstract: "It was a pleasure to present my PhD work at the Natural Language and Text Processing Lab, Utrecht University. I introduced two complementary frameworks for studying lexical semantic change: (1) SIBling — models change along Sentiment, Intensity, and Breadth; and (2) LSC-Eval — generates synthetic benchmarks for evaluating methods to detect change. Together, they offer new tools for tracing socially significant conceptual shifts, with applications to mental health concepts.
