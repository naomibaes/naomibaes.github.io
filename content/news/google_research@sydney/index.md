### Google Research

I am honoured to have been selected to attend the Google Research @ Sydney Event at the first Google research facility in Australia, with my colleague and lab mate Jemima Kang, 18 February 2025.

### More Information
As a PhD student using contextualized embeddings and large language models to understand lexical semantic change in mental health concepts, I was inspired by the projects that the talented Google Australia team is advancing. Their innovations in a breadth of domains - from multilingual large language models to operations research to hearing accessibility to open models - are state of the art.

I am excited to see these projects develop as technology progresses and as the team continues to make breakthroughs. With Australia's history of pioneering advances like the internet, Wi-Fi, cochlear implants, and Google Maps, it has the potential to lead in many more innovations despite its insular location.

Thank you to Google Australia for hosting this event and to my PhD supervisors, Nick Haslam and Ekaterina Vylomova, for their invaluable support.
