abstract: The present study evaluates semantic shifts in mental health-related concepts
  in two diachronic corpora spanning 1970-2016, one academic and one general. It evaluates
  whether their meanings have broadened to encompass less severe phenomena and whether
  they have become more pathology related. It applies a recently proposed methodology
  (Baes et al., 2023) to examine whether words collocating with a sample of mental
  health concepts have become less emotionally intense and develops a new way to examine
  whether the concepts increasingly co-occur with pathology-related terms. In support
  of the first hypothesis, mental health-related concepts became associated with less
  emotionally intense language in the psychology corpus (addiction, anger, stress,
  worry) and in the general corpus (addiction, grief, stress, worry). In support of
  the second hypothesis, mental health-related concepts came to be more associated
  with pathology-related language in psychology (addiction, grief, stress, worry)
  and in the general corpus (grief, stress). Findings demonstrate that some mental
  health concepts have become normalized and/or pathologized, a conclusion with important
  social and cultural implications.
