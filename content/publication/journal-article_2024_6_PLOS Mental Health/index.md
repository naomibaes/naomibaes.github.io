abstract: Substantial attention has been paid to the language of mental ill health, but the generic terms used to refer to it–“mental illness”, “psychiatric condition”, “mental health problem” and so forth–have largely escaped empirical scrutiny. We examined changes in the prevalence of alternative terms in two large English language text corpora from 1940 to 2019. Twenty-four terms were studied, compounds of four adjectival expressions (“mental”, “mental health”, “psychiatric”, “psychological”) and six nouns (“condition”, “disease”, “disorder”, “disturbance”, “illness”, “problem”). Terms incorporating “condition”, “disease” and “disturbance” became less popular over time, whereas those involving “psychiatric”, “mental health” and “illness” became more popular. Although there were some trends away from terms with medical connotations and towards more normalizing expressions, “mental illness” consolidated its position as the dominant term over the study period.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This study proposes a computational framework to evaluate lexical semantic change in a way that economically integrates forms identified by historical linguists and uses it to analyze semantic shifts in mental health and mental illness.
