#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

[Naomi Baes](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/855406-naomi-baes) is a doctoral researcher at the intersection of **Psychology** and **Natural Language Processing**. Supported by an *Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship* and supervised by [Professor Nick Haslam](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6837-nicholas-haslam) and [Dr Ekaterina Vylomova](http://kat.academy/), her primary focus involves **modelling conceptual change in mental health concepts** using **language models** and **historical corpora**. With her supervisors, she co-developed **SIBling**, a multidimensional framework for evaluating semantic change across three major dimensions (*Sentiment*, *Intensity*, and *Breadth*) and led the development of **LSC-Eval** (with her supervisors and collaborators [Dr Haim Dubossarsky](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2EDsENQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Raphaël Merx](https://www.rapha.dev/)), a benchmarking framework that uses LLM-generated synthetic corpora to evaluate semantic change detection methods. Her work **applies** these frameworks to diverse corpora to model conceptual change and uncover its social and cultural drivers, and has been presented at leading venues including **ACL 2024**, **ACL 2025** (forthcoming), **IC2S2 2025** (forthcoming), and **EMNLP (LChange’23)**. Naomi also contributes to SemEval tasks ([BRIGHTER](https://brighter-dataset.github.io/): multilingual emotion recognition) and serves on program committees (**[NLP4Democracy](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/nlp4democracy/)** and **[SEM2025](https://starsem2025.github.io/)**).
